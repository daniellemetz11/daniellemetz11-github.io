# Things to Do:
- VS Code  https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Git  https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Create a github account  (that's this website!)

# Git Basics:
- Create a "repository" (project) on Github
- "Clone" (copy) that repo to your local computer
- Add a file to the local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
- "Push" those changes to a branch on the remote repo
- Now anyone who has access to your repo can see the changes that you pushed
- If someone makes changes in the remote repo, you have to "pull" those changes to your local repo

# Git Commands for terminal:
- git init , initialize an existing directory as a Git repo
- git clone [url], retrieve an existing repo
- git status, show modified files
- git add, add a file to your next commit (save)
- git commit -m "commit message here", to save your changes to your local branch with a message
- git push, push your commits to your branch on the remote repo
